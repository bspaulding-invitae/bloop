  /**
   * Enables internal bloop implementation of fatal warnings.
   *
   * Having fatal warnings implemented inside the compiler has several
   * drawbacks:
   *
   * 1. Bloop receives a failed compilation when there is a warning. A failed
   * compilation doesn't allow us to cache the work done during an incremental
   * compiler cycle and the compilation products generated are thrown away.
   * This means next time we compile we need to redo the work of compiling all
   * changed source files when we would only want to recompile the files that
   * produced a fatal warning.
   *
   * 2. When warnings are produced, Metals doesn't have access to the class
   * files generated by the failed compilation. This affects negatively the
   * editing experience in the editor.
   *
   * To work around these limitations, we remove `-Xfatal-warnings` from the
   * scalac options passed to the compiler and we implement fatal warnings
   * ourselves in our reporter implementation.
   *
   * Our implementation promotes warnings to errors just before we're going to
   * report them but still represents warnings as warnings in the analysis
   * file. At the same time, it also treats successful compilations with fatal
   * warnings as errors at the very end of the compilation pipeline, after all
   * the compilation passes have been done in a build graph, and guarantees
   * that it works for clients that have their compilations deduplicated.
   *
   * All in all, implementing fatal warnings reproduces the previous behavior
   * in the compiler but without the inconveniences of handling compilation
   * results as failures when only fatal warnings are solely responsible for
   * the failed result.
